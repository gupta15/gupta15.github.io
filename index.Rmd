<h3>STILL CURIOUS? READ ON:</h3>

<br>

> I grew up in India where I also completed my medical school and moved to the US for further training. I worked with a leading cardiovascular outcomes research group at Yale where I led several projects to investigate gender- and race-based differences in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Through my work, I studied the complex interplay of patho-physiological, socio-demographic, financial and societal barriers that may be driving these differences. My work has been published in top cardiology journals and presented in national and international cardiology meetings. Besides, I have served as a Section Editor for the Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes journal and a reviewer for several cardiovascular and internal medicine journals. I am currently pursuing my cardiology fellowship and Masters in patient-oritented research at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. I enjoy working with data and constantly seek to learn ways to improve data visualization. I am working on developing methods to improve communication of risk for heart disease with interactive visualization techniques, that patients and providers will be able to utilize.
